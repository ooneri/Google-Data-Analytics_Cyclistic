# Google Data Analytics Project : Cyclistic　bike-share　

## Project Summary
This project is a part of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on cousera.
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. 
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. 

## ASK
The director of marketing, Lily Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth　rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers.　She has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 
Therefore, the business task is to analyze the company's historical bike-trip data and identify differences between casual riders and annual members and show the insights for exectives' decision making. 
 
Key questions to guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
